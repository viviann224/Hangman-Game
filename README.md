##**GETTING STARTED**:
The program should run automatically.

##**PREREQUISITES**:

##**HOW TO PLAY**:
The game starts when the page is loaded. There is a secret word that is autopopulated with dashes, "-", for the user to guess the word. Before typing a letter from the keyboard, it is useful to look at the "HINT" on the center left side of the page.

The user has a max of 10 guesses. Each time a word is guessed correctly, the user scores a point.

When the user runs out of guesses or if the user guess correctly, a display message will tell the user that they won or lost.
The game will continue to right after the prompt to either restart or continue.
